KSocha:Yes! As always, please SHOW your work and EXPLAIN your answers for Writing Challenge Problems! Even if you don't arrive at a final answer, show us what you tried!
KSocha:
KSocha:Let's get started!
KSocha:Prealgebra 1
Week 13: Arithmetic with Decimals
KSocha:As you already know, not all numbers are integers. We've seen how to write some of the numbers between the integers as fractions.
KSocha:Today we'll talk about another way to write the numbers between the integers: decimals.
KSocha:First, though, let's quickly chat about how our system of writing integers works!
KSocha:Once upon a time, the number of days in a year (say) might have been written like this:
KSocha:http://aops-classroom.s3.amazonaws.com/prealg/ticks.png
KSocha:Later, other systems were developed. For example, the ancient Romans wrote that number as CCCLXV.
KSocha:We have an even shorter way of writing it: 
365.
 How do these three symbols stand for the same thing as all those unwieldy tick marks above?
KSocha:In other words, what do the "
3
,
" the "
6
,
" and the "
5
" really mean in the number 
365
?
Wolvezz98:300 + 60 + 5
bookmallow:300+60+5
ananya22609:300+60+5
cwc28:300, 60, and 5
RyanWang:3 is hundred, 6 is 10s, 5 is ones
Atiny-17:3 stands for 300
rocketdev:300 + 60 + 5 = 365
zz456:they mean 300+60+5
blue_ox_253:The hundreds place, the tens place, and the ones place
ksuppalapati:3=300,6=60, and5=5
Joshuahoonkim:3 one hundreds 6 tens and 5 ones
nyc007:3*100+6*10+5*1
buffalochickenwings:hundreths tens and ones?
connorthecow:(3•100)+(6•10)+(5•1)
AneeshRK:300 + 60 + 5
KSocha:Right! When we write 
365
,
 we really mean "
3
 hundreds, 
6
 tens, and 
5
 ones."
KSocha:We can even write 
3
6
5
 as
3
00
+
6
0
+
5
=
3
⋅
100
+
6
⋅
10
+
5
⋅
1.
This expanded form of 
3
6
5
 shows how the placement of each digit affects the overall value of the number.
KSocha:(oooh, I'm gonna have fun with colors today!)
KSocha:
KSocha:Or we could emphasize the base 
10
 like this:
3
00
+
6
0
+
5
=
3
⋅
10
2
+
6
⋅
10
1
+
5
⋅
10
0
.
KSocha:Our system uses place values. The actual number a digit stands for depends on its position. You probably take this system for granted, since it's been around all your life (and much longer than that). However, there was a time when place-value notation was an almost miraculous new technology!
KSocha:Why "miraculous"? Well, try doing arithmetic with Roman numerals -- or, worse, tick marks. It's a pain.
Hype-otanuse:
MATH_SLAYER:i agree
ksuppalapati:yes
blue_ox_253:mhm agreed
KSocha:It's also kind of a pain to do arithmetic with fractions sometimes. By extending place value notation to non-integers, we can make a lot of arithmetic easier.
KSocha:To write integers, we use the place values 
1
,
 
10
,
 
100
,
 
1000
,
 etc. These are powers of 
10
,
 so we also call our place-value system base 10.
KSocha:Why 
10
?
Solve_for_x:fingers
MilesEdgeworth_thegreat:fingers
connorthecow:We have 10 fingers
Joshuahoonkim:because we have ten fingers
rocketdev:We have ten fingers
Hype-otanuse:just add a zero each time it makes it easy. 
FireWizard:u can get anyplace value by mutliplyin or dividing 1 by tens
bookmallow:it is easier to count by
BigThoth:we have 10 fingers
nyc007:we have 10 fingers
Gigi_Pony:because in 10s they smybolize new places
buffalochickenwings:because it was the simplist?
cwc28:Because 10 is easy to multiply
KSocha:Lots of possibilities. But probably because we have 
10
 fingers... though the ancient Sumerians used a base 
60
 system, and they didn't have 
60
 fingers or 
60
 toes or 
60
 anything, as far as I know.)
KSocha:(Secretly, I always think that dolphins must count "base 
2
"! LOL)
HolisticEagle:lol
connorthecow:LOL
Ejaops:LOL
Solve_for_x:LOL
FireWizard:lol
blue_ox_253:LOL
bookmallow:
Wolvezz98:maybe the Sumerians were aliens!!!!
AliceWang:haha
HolisticEagle:haha
Hype-otanuse:Haha. two fins  :)
RyanWang:lololololol
oliverz3233:
Joshuahoonkim:nice
RyanWang:
MATH_SLAYER:hahaha
PeaceLoveSoccer:lol
RyanWang:
KSocha:So, in base 
10
,
 the place values we've used so far are the following powers of 
10
:
10
0
=
1
10
1
=
10
10
2
=
100
 
⋮
KSocha:So, seriously now, how can we extend this system so that we can express numbers between the integers using our regular digits 
(
0
 through 
9
)
?
KSocha:We can keep raising 
10
 to larger and larger positive integer powers to get bigger place values, but how could we get smaller place values?
BigThoth:negative exponents
bookmallow:10^-1?
FireWizard:times by 1/10 or divide by 10
nyc007:10^-1, 10^-2,...
rocketdev:we can do negative powers
KSocha:Nice! In keeping with the powers of 
10
 idea, we can extend into the powers of 
10
 with negative exponents:
10
−
1
=
1
/
10
10
−
2
=
1
/
100
10
−
3
=
1
/
1000
 
⋮
KSocha:Just as integers can be broken down into powers of 
10
 
(
as in 
365
=
3
⋅
100
+
6
⋅
10
+
5
⋅
1
)
,
 we can also break down non-integers into powers of 
10
 using tenths, hundredths, and so on.
KSocha:For example, how many tenths and hundredths make up one-quarter?
KSocha:In other words, how can we write 
1
4
 as 
x
10
+
y
100
,
 where 
x
 and 
y
 are each 
1
 digit?
KSocha:We can't write 
1
4
 as some whole number of tenths, but we can write it as some number of hundredths:
1
4
=
25
100
.
Wolvezz98:2 tenths and 5 hundredths
nyc007:x=2, y=5
MilesEdgeworth_thegreat:2/10 and 5/100
Hype-otanuse:x=2 and y=5
connorthecow:2 tenths, 5 hundredths.
KSocha:Then we write out 
25
 in terms of its place value so that we can break 
25
100
 into tenths and hundredths with each numerator a single digit:
25
100
=
20
+
5
100
=
20
100
+
5
100
=
2
10
+
5
100
.
KSocha:We could then write that 
25
100
=
2
⋅
10
−
1
+
5
⋅
10
−
2
,
 using what we know about negative powers and the fact that 
10
2
=
100.
KSocha:But the whole point of place-value notation is that we don't write the powers of 
10
;
 we just use the position of the digits to show their value.
KSocha:And, as a lot of you told me, in this case, we write one-quarter as 
0.25
,
 or sometimes simply as 
.25
.
KSocha:The decimal point (the ".") marks the place just to the right of the units digit, where the negative powers of 
10
 begin. So, for example, 
0.469
 means "four tenths, six hundredths, and nine thousandths:"
0.469

KSocha:Note: we usually include the

KSocha:Everyone okay with that?
KSocha:Good! We'll practice a lot. Notice how each place value represents a different power of 
10.
 Values after the decimal point now represent negative powers of 
10.
KSocha:Let's take a quick look at the first few place values after the decimal point:
KSocha:
0.1

−
1
one tenth
0.01

−
2
one hundredth
0.001

HolisticEagle:so u want powers of 10?
KSocha:Well, powers of 
10
 help us understand what number we actually have.
KSocha:And they help us see patterns and do arithmetic quickly. For example, we can spot this pattern:
KSocha:

KSocha:Each time we divide by 
10
,
 what happens?
MATH_SLAYER:There is one more 0 as a decimal place
connorthecow:There is another zero between the . and number
rocketdev:The decimal point moves one place to the left
BigThoth:one zero gets added
Gigi_Pony:it becomes smaller
Ham1234:a zero is added
Joshuahoonkim:more zeros in-between the decimal point and 1
Hype-otanuse:add one zero between the decimal point and the one
bobochen:1 more zero appears
ananya22609:the number gets smaller
KSocha:Each time we divide by 
10
,
 the decimal point marches a step to the left (or the 
1
 marches a place to the right).
KSocha:(This is helpful - try to think about your decimal moving LEFT if you expect a smaller answer, like you would when dividing by 
10
.)
KSocha:So how do we write the decimal for 
10
−
7
=
1
10
7
?

KSocha:Good! We have 
10
−
7
=
0.0000001
,
 where we have 
6
 zeroes between the decimal point and 
1.
 Or in other words, 
1
 is 
7
 places to the right of the decimal point.
KSocha:In general, how do we write the decimal for 
1
10
n
 (or 
10
−
n
,
 which is the same thing)?
KSocha:In other words, how many zeroes do we place between the decimal point and the 
1
 when we write 
1
10
n
?
puppy02:n-1 zero's
connorthecow:n-1 zeros
oliverz3233:n-1
MATH_SLAYER:n-1
bobochen:n-1
rocketdev:n - 1 zeros
Gigi_Pony:n-1 places
KSocha:We can write 
1
/
10
n
 as 
0.00
…
0001
,
 where the 
1
 is in the 
n
-th position after the decimal point. This means that there are 
(
n
−
1
)
 zeroes after the decimal point (not 
n
 zeroes!).
KSocha:One billion is 
10
9
,
 or 
1,000,000,000.
 What is the decimal for one billionth?
Solve_for_x:0.000000001
MathGirl318:0.000000001?
AneeshRK:0.000000001
buffalochickenwings:0.000000001
rainbow_unicorn:0.000000001
KSocha:The decimal for one billionth is 
0.000
 
000
 
001.
 (That's eight zeroes and then a one to the right of the decimal point, so nine digits in all to the right of the decimal point, as expected. I used spaces to make the zeroes easier to count.)
KSocha:Unfortunately, while we use commas for whole numbers to help make them easier to read, there's no similar symbol to help break up long decimals. So adding space like this can help make them easier to read. If you choose to use this same strategy in a solution, just make sure that you're clear it's a continuation of the original number and not a new number.
KSocha:Careful with the number of zeroes! The 
1
 is in the billionths place, which is the ninth place after the decimal point.
KSocha:There are eight zeroes after the decimal point, because the 
1
 is in the ninth place after the decimal. On the other hand, there are nine zeroes in 
1,000,000,000.
KSocha:Okay, another short one:
KSocha:How would we write "thirty-one and nine thousandths?"
KSocha:Careful! It's 
31
 and...something.

 the third place value after the decimal point. So, thirty-one and nine thousandths is

.
 Notice that we mark the unused place values with

KSocha:Be careful! Remember that 
10
−

 has no zeroes between the decimal point and the 
1
,
 while 
10
−
2
 has 
1
 such zero. And 
10

6
 has 
5
:

10
−
6
=
1
1,000,000
=
0.000
001.
KSocha:Okay. Altogether, we have:
10

.
10
−
1
=
0
.1
10
−
2
=
0

.
KSocha:So what are we doing with these numbers? Are we multiplying them? Adding them? Or something else?
rainbow_unicorn:adding them
kvbhaskar:adding
Ham1234:adding them
mathgymnast1:adding them
buffalochickenwings:adding
connorthecow:adding them

bookmallow:+
rocketdev:Add them
andy09:adding
KSocha:Right! And notice, we line them up nicely at the decimal point, with equal place values directly above and below each other, to make them easier to add.
KSocha:What is our sum in decimal form?
bookmallow:1000 + 0.1 + 0.01 + 0.000001 = 1000.110001

MATH_SLAYER:1,000.110 001
Babawa:1000.110001
PeaceLoveSoccer:1000.110001
KSocha:Right, what we want is a single number that has 
1
's
 in all the places that stand for the powers of 
10
 above.
KSocha:We can write 
10
3

−
1

10
−
2

10
−

 as 
1000.110

.
KSocha:If this is new to you, think about how place value works in integers. For example, 
1010
 is how we write 
10
3
+
10
1
.
 The example we just did is no different, except that we're using negative powers of 
10
 too!
KSocha:For this next example, we'll need some digits other than 
0
 and 
1
:

KSocha:The first term,

,
 tells us that we have a

;[asy]<br />size(200);<br /><br />real a = 1.5;<br />real s = 0.9;<br />void blank(pair center=(0, 0)) {<br />  path line = (-a, 0)--(a, 0);<br />  draw(shift(center) * line);<br />}<br /><br />dot(origin);<br />int n = 3;<br /><br />// negative exponents<br />for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {<br />  pair center_i = (2a + 3.5a*i, 0);<br />  blank(center_i);<br />  string num_i = string(-i-1);<br />  string label_i = "$10^{" + num_i + "}$";<br />  label(scale(s) * label_i, center_i, S);<br />}<br /><br />// nonnegative exponents<br />for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {<br />  pair center_i = (-2a - 3.5a*i, 0);<br />  blank(center_i);<br />  string num_i = string(i);<br />  string label_i = "$10^{" + num_i + "}$";<br />  label(scale(s) * label_i, center_i, S);<br /><br />  if (i == 2) {<br />    label(scale(1.25) * "$2$", center_i, N, blue);<br />  }<br />}<br /><br />[/asy]

KSocha:The

KSocha:So what's the final answer?
andy09:204.06
nyc007:204.06
Mathcat777:204.06

Ejaops:204.060
cwc28:204.06

 based on the picture. Is that number any different from 
204.06
?
bookmallow:no

HolisticEagle:noo
Hathaway07:Nope!
LucasHong:no
RyanWang:nope!
puppy02:NO!! They are the same numbers
KSocha:Nope—they're the same! We can add zeros at the end of a decimal without changing the value. So 
204.06
=
204.060
=
204.0600.
KSocha:Similarly, although it's not usually done, we could also do this at the front of a number. So 
204.06
=
0204.06.


But most of the time, we leave off any leading or trailing zeros. So we'd just write 
204.06.
KSocha:Okay, I went very deliberately and carefully through those, so let's see if we can pick up the pace a little. Ask if you have questions, and remember the transcript will be available after class.
KSocha:ADDING AND SUBTRACTING
KSocha:Decimals make addition and subtraction easy as cake. As an example, let's compare these two sums:
KSocha:
458
+
161
619
4.58
+
1.61
6.19
KSocha:The second sum involves decimals, but it works on the same principles as the first.
KSocha:I'll write out what we're really saying in each of these sums, in terms of place value.

KSocha:Make sure you understand these steps. Do you see how we collect together multiples of the same place value, then carry 
10
 tenths to make

 unit?
KSocha:(pausing for you to read...)
KSocha:Good! This shows why our usual method of "carrying" works.
KSocha:If you've mastered addition with integers, you'll find that addition with decimals is just the same. The only thing you have to be careful about is making sure that equal place values are aligned.
KSocha:You wouldn't add

5
.0798

KSocha:Then we add the columns from right to left as usual, carrying when we need to.
KSocha:If the gaps in the rightmost columns bother you, you can think of them as

 Express your answer as a decimal.

KSocha:Thousandths are the third place value after the decimal point, so 
3
1000
 is 
0.003.
KSocha:Writing a 
0
 to the left of the decimal point is a common way of emphasizing the decimal. It makes it easier for me to read quickly, so I prefer that you write the 
0.
 That way, I can see that you understand!
KSocha:Also, it helps out when you are aligning problems on paper.
KSocha:As with addition, we want to be sure to align the decimal points in our problem:
8
.
−
0
.003
KSocha:Why didn't we write this?
8
−
0
.003
blue_ox_253:Because the decimal point needs to line up
Ham1234:because we have to alighn the decimal points
bookmallow:PLACE VALUE
MATH_SLAYER:because we have to line up place value
Gigi_Pony:Becuase the decial points are not aligined
MathGirl318:the place values arent correct
YelloShirt:That's not lined up correctly.
oliverz3233:The 8 is not in the thousandths place
JerryXia:people will think that it is 8 thousandths
cwc28:That wouldn’t be lining the decimal points up
Hathaway07:the decimals don’t line up!
ksuppalapati:because the 8 and 0 are in units place so the have to line up
AliceWang:because 0.003 dosent have the value as 8
rocketdev:8 look like 0.008
Mathcat777:because it isn't lined up.
rainbow_unicorn:it is 8 ones, not 8 thousandths!
KSocha:The 
8
 is in the ones place, not the thousandths place. We need to align it with the ones place in 
0.003
,
 which is that 
0
 before the decimal point.
KSocha:We've written 
8
 with a decimal point to help line up the corresponding place values. We could even write it like this:
8
.000
−
0
.003
KSocha:Now we can do long subtraction as usual:
KSocha:

KSocha:Note that our answer makes sense. We're subtracting a small number from 
8
,
 so we expect the result to be a tiny bit less than 
8.
 Thinking about whether or not your answer makes sense is a great way to check your decimal arithmetic.
KSocha:We do exactly the same work we'd do to compute 
8000
−
3
,
 only the decimal point is in a different place.
KSocha:Are there any questions about adding and subtracting decimals?
RyanWang:no mam!

And similarly, the

KSocha:We've got our answer!
(
24.68
)
⋅
(

)
=
246.8
KSocha:The decimal point shifted one place to the right!
KSocha:You already knew that you could multiply an integer by 
10
 by adding a 
0
 to the end. That's really the same as shifting the decimal point to the right; the extra 
0
 marks the units place which was vacated when the original units digit got promoted to tens.
orangecatboy: 
KSocha:(That 
0
 which moves into the units place was previously in the tenths place, to the right of the decimal point! Remember, an integer like 
37
 can also be written as a decimal, like 
37.0
 -- we usually don't write the 
0
 because we aren't forced to. But when we multiply by 
10
,
 the 
0
 is forced into view: 
37.0
⋅
10
=
370.
)
KSocha:And remember, we were multiplying by 
10
 so we expected a bigger answer.
KSocha:What happens if we multiply a decimal by 
1,000,000
?
KSocha:Where does the decimal point go?
puppy02:Move the decimal 6 places to the right!!
ksuppalapati:6 to the right
RyanWang:it moves to the right 6 spaces?
BigThoth:you shift the decimal to the right 6 times
bookmallow:right 6
rocketdev:6 places to the right
Littlecheetah:move the decimal point right 6 places
bookmallow:right by 6 places
cwc28:6 places to the right
Joshuahoonkim:we go the right because it gets bigger, unlike division where we go to the left
KSocha:Multiplying by 
1,000,000
=
10
6
 is the same as multiplying by 
10
 six times. So, we shift the decimal point 
6
 places to the right.
KSocha:So for example, what is 
(
42.88
)
⋅
(
1,000,000
)
?
KSocha:Shifting the decimal point just two places to the right would give an integer, 
4288.
 So, when we shift the decimal point six places, we end up with four vacancies that have to be filled with 
0

 referred to as "

KSocha:

KSocha:In our final answer, we write only the zeroes we need: just enough to show clearly where the decimal point is.
KSocha:Remember, if you're ever confused about whether to shift the decimal point to the left or right, think about whether you want your answer to be larger or smaller. That will usually clear things up.
KSocha:For example, we know 
(
42.88
)
⋅
(
0.001
)
 should be smaller than 
42.88.
 If we shift the wrong way, we'll get

 which we instantly see must be wrong.
KSocha:To make it even clearer that 
(

⋅
(

 should be smaller than

 we might also think of 
(

 as multiplying 
42.88
 by

,
 
0.213
,
 
0.13
,
 
0.2
,
 
0.12
,
 
0.031.
We want to put these in order from least to greatest.
KSocha:All the numbers in this list are between 
0
 and 
1.
 The first digit where they differ is the tenths digit.
KSocha:Which number is smallest?

KSocha:The only number in the list with a 
0
 in the tenths place is 
0.031
,
 so this must be the smallest. (It's the only number in the list which is smaller than one-tenth.)
KSocha:Next we have the numbers whose tenths digit is 
1.
 Which numbers are those?
MathGirl318:0.123, 0.13, 0.12
bookmallow:0.12, 0.123, 0.13
Ejaops:0.123, 0.13,0.12
KSocha:There are three numbers with a 
1
 in the tenths place: 
0.123
,
 
0.13
,
 and 
0.12.
 To compare them, what should we look at next?
MathGirl318:the hundredths
bobochen:the hundreths
KSocha:By looking at the hundredths digit, we can see that 
0.13
 is the biggest of these three numbers. But 
0.123
 and 
0.12
 both have the same hundredths digit, so we have to go to the thousandths.
KSocha:The thousandths digit of 
0.123
 is 
3.
 What is the thousandths digit of 
0.12
?

,
 so its thousandths digit is

KSocha:We have
0.031
<
0.12
<
0.123
<
0.13
<
0.2
<
0.213.
KSocha:We could also have figured this out by padding the numbers in our list with extra 
0
's
 so that they all have three digits after the decimal point:
0.123
,
 
0.213
,
 
0.130
,
 
0.200
,
 
0.120
,
 
0.031
Now they're all effectively written in terms of thousandths. The decimals above are equal to
123
1000
,
 
213
1000
,
 
130
1000
,
 
200
1000
,
 
120
1000
,
 
31
1000
,
so we can just compare the numerators:
KSocha:
31
120
123
130
200
213
0.031
0.120
0.123
0.130
0.200
0.213
KSocha:This only works because we made all the denominators the same! It would be a mistake to compare 
0.2
 to 
0.12
 by comparing 
2
 and 
12.
 Rather, we should compare 
20
 to 
12
 (or 
200
 to 
120
,
 as we did here).
KSocha:However, when you do it properly, comparing decimals is easy -- much easier than comparing fractions! That's one of the reasons that we use decimals in the first place.
KSocha:SUMMARY
KSocha:Today we learned how to extend the base 
10
 number system to include numbers that aren't integers. These numbers, called decimals, have a decimal point, to the left of which are digits with the usual place values 
(
1
,
 
10
,
 
10
2
,
 
10
3
,
 etc.
)
.
 On the right side of the decimal point, the digits have place values one-tenth 
(
10
−
1
)
,
 one-hundredth 
(
10
−
2
)
,
 and so on.
KSocha:For example,
32.71
is shorthand for
3
⋅
(
10
)
+
2
⋅
(
1
)
+
7
⋅
(
1
10
)
+
1
⋅
(
1
100
)
or
3
⋅
(
10
1
)
+
2
⋅
(
10
0
)
+
7
⋅
(
10
−
1
)
+
1
⋅
(
10
−
2
)
.
KSocha:Adding and subtracting decimals works just like regular long addition and long subtraction, except that we must be careful to align digits with the same place values. (In practice, we just make sure the decimal points line up.) It helps to remember that any digits that aren't written are 
0.
 For example, 
2.3
 is the same as 
2.30
 or 
2.300.
KSocha:To multiply a decimal by 
10
,
 we shift all the digits one place to the left (or achieve the same effect by shifting the decimal point one place to the right). This may force us to write a 
0
 that was previously invisible. To divide by 
10
,
 we do the same thing, but shift in the opposite direction. To multiply or divide by a power of 
10
,
 we shift the digits (or the decimal point) multiple places; for example, to multiply by 
10
5
,
 we would shift the digits five places to the left, or do the same thing by shifting the decimal point five places to the right.
KSocha:There are lots of methods for multiplying and dividing decimals. When in doubt, we can always reduce these problems to two steps: multiplying (or dividing) integers, and multiplying (or dividing) powers of ten. For example,
(
0.000025
)
⋅
(
1600
)
=
(
25
⋅
10
−
6
)
⋅
(
16
⋅
10
2
)
=
(
25
⋅
16
)
⋅
(
10
−
6
⋅
10
2
)
=
(
400
)
⋅
(
10
−
4
)
=
0.04
.
KSocha:To make sure we've done our work correctly, it's a good idea to estimate the answer using simpler numbers that are close to the original numbers that went into the computation.
KSocha:To compare two decimals, we look at the highest place value where their digits are different. We can also write "invisible" 0's to make our decimals the same length, which makes them easier to compare.
KSocha:Next week, we'll talk about rounding, then we'll talk more about converting between decimals and fractions, then we'll discuss some decimals that never end!
KSocha:Good work, everyone!

nyc007:well you do \sqrt{2} with the dollar signs
KSocha:You might have written it as 
204.060
 based on the picture. Is that number any different from 
204.06
?
KSocha:Let's pull it back out of expanded form. What is the right hand side of this equation as a decimal?
KSocha:Since 
1,000
=
10
3
,
 multiplying by 
1,000
 is the same as multiplying by 
10
 three times. So, we shift the decimal point 
3
 places to the right.
